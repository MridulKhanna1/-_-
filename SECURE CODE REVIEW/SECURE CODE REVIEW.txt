FOR A SECURE CODE REVIEW WE WILL USE 
AN OPEN SOURCE TOOL NAMED "BANDIT"
TO INSTALL BANDIT IN YOUR SYSTEM 
GO TO CMD
WRITE THIS COMMAND
PIP INSTALL BANDIT






REVIEW OF THE VULNERABLE CODE:
A Flask app appears to be run with debug=True, 
which exposes the Werkzeug debugger 
and allows the execution of arbitrary code.










REVIEW OF THE FIXED CODE:
Test results:
        No issues identified.

NOW CODE IS FIXED




THANKYOU
